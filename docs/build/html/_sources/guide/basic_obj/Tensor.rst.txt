Tensor
==========
Tensor is the basic building block of Cytnx, just like numpy.array or torch.tensor. 
In fact, the API of Tensor is almost the same as torch.tensor. 

Let's take a look on how to use it.


Define a Tensor
----------------
Just like numpy.array/torch.tensor, Tensor is created using generator such as zero(),arange(),ones().

For example, suppose we want to define a rank-3 tensor with shape (3,4,5).
