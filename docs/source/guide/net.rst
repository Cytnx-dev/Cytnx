Network
=================
The **Network** object provides a skeleton of a Tensor network diagram. Users can write a *Network file*, which will serve as the blue print of a TN structure, and contract multiple Tensors at once with optimal contraction order optimized automatically within the **Network** object. Further more, user can plot the Tensor network diagram from *Network file* directly in python API to check the implementation.
